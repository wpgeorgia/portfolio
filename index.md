## 🌲 GIS Suitability: Pine Tree Viability in North Texas

**Objective:** Assess ecological suitability for growing Christmas trees near Dallas, TX.

**Approach:**
- Compared native habitat conditions of **Virginia Pine** and **Eastern White Pine** to North Texas environmental data.
- Pulled geospatial layers on temperature, precipitation, soil pH, and elevation.
- Classified each factor into ordinal ranks (0 = not suitable to 2 = suitable).
- Combined layers using Raster Calculator in ArcGIS Pro to score overall viability (0–8 scale).

**Outcome:**  
Viable areas were concentrated in East Texas (esp. near Tyler), with temperature being the most limiting factor across the study area.
